    "This Jupyter environment was used to recreate _Network Assisted Content Distribution for Adaptive Bitrate\n",
    "Video Streaming_ experiment by Divyashri Bhat, Amr Rizk, Michael Zink, and Ralf Steinmetz (DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3083187.3083196)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes that you have created two leases in Chameleon:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A lease for 5 node and (optional) 1 floating IP\n",
    "- A lease for several nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "These leases contain your server node and your client nodes respectively. You can reserve these resources using the Chameleon Cloud web interface, or using the python-chi library which allows access of Chameleon resources through Python. If you don't know how to reserve these resources on python-chi, a great tutorial on how to reserve and use networking resources can be found in the [Python Create Isolated VLAN](../../tutorials/networking/Python-Networking-CreateIsolatedVLAN.ipynb) tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is strongly encouraged that this experiment is run out of the [chameleoncloud_SABR](https://github.com/mwhicks-dev/chameleoncloud_SABR) experimental repository as some files references can be found there, and have been linked appropriately in this notebook."
